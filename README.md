# 5-FU-PBPK-Model

Modeling of published clinical 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) and uracil studies for model evaluation

## Repository files
Within this repository, we distribute whole-body parent-metabolite PBPK models for 5-FU and uracil, as well as their metabolites 5,6-dihydrofluorouracil and 5,6-dihydrouracil. The models were developed and evaluated using published clinical studies. The files contain 5-FU administrations as bolus injectsion and infusions as well as 5-FU and uracil administrations as oral solutions. Moreover, diurnal variations were simulated for constant-rate and chronomodulated infusions.
